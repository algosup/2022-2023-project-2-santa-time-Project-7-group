Project progress report 2nd of December 2022:

**Current**->

This week we added a new DB that handles latitude and longitude and returns the UTC. Up until now we were using an external API.\
HTTPS was added to all the DB calls via a GO proxy after we found out that HTTP requests through a website in HTTPS made problems.\
An advent calendar was created to give more appeal to the webpage. It has a Gacha (lottery draw) system as we decided to target our promotion toward young people.\
We did a production ready version of the website that handles the new processes given above.

**Lateness**->

The production ready version was not pushed yet which is why we added the option of opening all past days on the calendar (people can join the ship anytime).\
Promotion started but is not entirely planned for now. We expect to really start it on Tuesday.

**Next Steps**->

Automate the system of fetching pictures for the advent calendar with Github fetches.\
We did not Dockerize the DB as it is really heavy, but we since we did a proxy we are thinking of load balancing through multiple accounts.If I forgot anything, feel free to notify me.\
