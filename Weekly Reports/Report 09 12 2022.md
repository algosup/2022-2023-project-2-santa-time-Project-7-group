We did a form that you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqAHefaN5VZwZLYZ6gXGjjgoCartBukMMH_14teIO7VdWhKA/viewform) which got us over 100 responses. We started to code counters that will be added to the db proxy that would help us target specific websites by counting the number of visits with a post.
- Server UP 24/7. We change it without ever stopping the server.
