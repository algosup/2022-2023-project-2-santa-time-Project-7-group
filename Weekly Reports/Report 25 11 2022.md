Project progress report 25th of November 2022:\
Group 7 managed to have a web server up this 25th of November, a DB is also set up with a size 3 times lighter than the originally expected one (50GB instead of 150GB).

**Current**->

- Database was put in a Linux virtual machine called with the API <http://noel.gq/api?q=> +value
- Server is on Azure within a Docker accessible in http (<http://20.54.158.48/>). Server is made in compiled Go in a Docker from scratch (that can only execute binaries) with a total size of 5.75MB.
- Partial https adaptation of this very server but with the domain name [http://catchyoursanta.ml](http://catchyoursanta.ml/), for now it does not work

**Lateness**->

- We were expecting to have the server in https before today's end of school hours
- Benchmarking the DB is on its way with this [Test Report - 24.11.22 .md](https://algosup.sharepoint.com/:t:/s/Schedule/ESlnm4bDQyRHra2tdI2GWr4BdGA79dfBQ0PLEC7QGZb9xw?e=dhMq4c) but still a bit late since massive attacks were not made.

**Next Steps**->

- Stress testing the server to see how the free account handle the load. If the price goes up too fast -> notify you and present a paid plan
- Having the server in HTTPS
- Try Kubernetes with free accounts instead of Azure's docker service
- DB may be dockerized or we may use a specialised DB service, still in testing.
- Starting the promotion
- Adding to the website some new ideas we have had
- Other
